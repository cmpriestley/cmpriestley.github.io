### THE FIELD FAR FROM A SOURCE

Return to linearised Einstein equations with matter.
> [Side note left] think of this like E&M equations in Lorenz gauge. $g_{\mu\nu}$ potential satisfies wave equation. $\partial_\mu \bar{h}^{\mu\nu}=0$ is 4-divergence free. (Lorenz-Fischer potential) useful reg.

$(*) \ \partial_\rho\partial^\rho \bar{h}_{\mu\nu} = -16\pi T_{\mu\nu}$
$\partial_\mu \bar{h}^{\mu\nu}=0$
> [Side note right] wave, gauge condition

As is the case for electromagnetism, we can solve (*) explicitly using a retarded Green's function:
> [Side note left] as is standard in Jackson, use t, x, z components
>
> [Side note right] modulus computed in euclidean space is practically as we normally think of it

$\bar{h}_{\mu\nu}(t, \mathbf{x}) = 4 \int d^3x' \frac{T_{\mu\nu}(t - |\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|, \mathbf{x'})}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|} \quad (\#)$

Where $|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|$ is computed in the Euclidean metric.
> [Side note left] (from source far away)

If matter is concentrated within a distance $d$ of the origin (so $T_{\mu\nu}=0$ for $|\mathbf{x'}|>d$), we can expand in the far field region where $r=|\mathbf{x}| \gg |\mathbf{x'}| \approx d$. Then
> [Side note in diagram] interested in field at point. look over past lightcone of pt. (that is where info comes from). integrate over past lightcone with some jacobian factor. tells me how much source from one side to go from another.

[Diagram showing a point `(t, x)` and its past lightcone intersecting with the source region at earlier times.]

$|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|^2 = r^2 - 2\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{x'} + |\mathbf{x'}|^2 = r^2(1 - 2\frac{\mathbf{\hat{x}}\cdot\mathbf{x'}}{r}) + O(\frac{d^2}{r^2})$

with $\mathbf{\hat{x}}=\mathbf{x}/r$. Hence, (use binomial expansion):
> [Side note] unit vector
>
> [Side note right] correction is inner product (i.e. vector pointing from origin to source & pos'n vector) so this is where $\hat{x}$ gets into formula

$|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}| = r(1-\frac{2\mathbf{\hat{x}}\cdot\mathbf{x'}}{r} + O(\frac{d^2}{r^2}))^{1/2} = r - \mathbf{\hat{x}}\cdot\mathbf{x'} + O(\frac{d^2}{r})$
> [Side note] next we Taylor expand so distance over large time we neglect

and $T_{\mu\nu}(t-|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|, \mathbf{x'}) = T_{\mu\nu}(t', \mathbf{x'}) + \mathbf{\hat{x}}\cdot\mathbf{x'} \partial_0 T_{\mu\nu}(t', \mathbf{x'}) + \dots$
where $t'=t-r$.
> [Side note] relativistic velocity?
>
> [Side note right] what do I mean by this? above timescale tells me which matter contributes to field at some time.

If $T_{\mu\nu}$ varies on a timescale of $\tau$ so that $\partial_0 T_{\mu\nu} \approx \frac{1}{\tau} T_{\mu\nu}$, then second term above is $O(d/\tau)$ which we can neglect if matter moves non-relativistically. We thus have,
> [Side note left] want to hear from first term in series, in integral. on $T_{ij}$ at the retarded time. and add up contributions to get $\bar{h}_{ij}$

$\bar{h}_{ij} = \frac{4}{r} \int d^3x' T_{ij}(t', \mathbf{x'}) \quad t'=t-r \quad (**)$

This gives the spatial components of $\bar{h}_{ij}$. To find remaining components we use gauge condition: $\partial_0 \bar{h}_{0i} = \partial_j \bar{h}_{ji}, \quad \partial_0 \bar{h}_{00} = \partial_i \bar{h}_{0i}$.

First solve for $\bar{h}_{0i}$ then $\bar{h}_{00}$.
> [Side note] note $\partial_\mu T^{\mu\nu}=0$

We can simplify the integral in ($**$) by recalling that $\partial_\mu T^{\mu\nu}=0$ (EM conservation) and that $T_{\mu\nu}(t', \mathbf{x'})$ vanishes for $|\mathbf{x'}|>d$.

> [Side note right] $(\partial_0 T^{0j} + \partial_i T^{ij} = 0)$

Symmetrising on $ij$

$\int d^3x T_{ij}(t, \mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2} \int d^3x[\partial_k(T_{0k}x_i)x_j + \frac{1}{2} T_{0k}\partial_k(x_i x_j)]$

> [Side note left] again pull out time derivatives this is integral over spatial derivs.

= $2 \int_V d^3x (\frac{1}{2} \partial_0 T^{00} x_i x_j)$ as above by divergence theorem
= $\frac{1}{2}\partial_0 \partial_0 \int d^3x T^{00}x^ix^j = \frac{1}{2}\ddot{I}_{ij}(t)$

Where $I_{ij}(t) = \int d^3x T^{00}(t, \mathbf{x})x^ix^j$.
> [Side note] 2nd moment of 00 component of EM tensor (mass energy) evaluated at time t.

Noting $T_{00} = T^{00}$ and $T_{ij}=T^{ij}$ we deduce,
$\bar{h}_{ij} = \frac{2}{r} \ddot{I}_{ij}(t-r) \quad \begin{matrix} r \gg d \\ \lambda \gg d \end{matrix}$
> [Side note right] (retarded time means light rays must have time to leave dist'n to arrive at me now. then dilute by $1/r$ to reflect spread over a sphere)

Now reconstruct remaining components using gauge condition.
> [Side note left] they are overdense indices so don't bring too much about indices vs coordinates

$\partial_0 \bar{h}_{0i} = \partial_j \bar{h}_{ji} = \partial_j (\frac{2}{r} \ddot{I}_{ij}(t-r))$
> [Side note right] Two free terms that contribute roughly

$\implies \bar{h}_{0i} = \frac{2}{r} \frac{x^j}{r} \ddot{I}_{ij}(t-r) - \frac{2}{r} \hat{x}^j \dddot{I}_{ij}(t-r) + k_i(\mathbf{x})$
> [Side note left] using chain rule and this fact

> [Side note right] $\partial_i(1/r) = - \hat{x}_i/r^2$. Hopefully, I've done this vector calculus right.

We now assume $r \gg \lambda$ so we are in radiation zone so can drop first term (it's $O(\lambda/r)$ relative to second) and get

$\bar{h}_{0i} = - \frac{2}{r} \hat{x}^j \dddot{I}_{ij}(t-r) + k_i(\mathbf{x})$

Now use,

$\implies \bar{h}_{00} = -2\partial_i (\frac{x^j}{r^2}\ddot{I}_{ij}(t-r)) + t\partial_i k_i(\mathbf{x}) + g(\mathbf{x})$

To fix constants of integration, return to
$\bar{h}_{\mu\nu} = 4 \int d^3x' \frac{T_{\mu\nu}(t-|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|, \mathbf{x'})}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}|}$

> [Side note right] also often want to apply energy via Noether's theorem, involving usually quantity conserved due to time symmetry but in general background we don't have time translation symmetry

> [Side note below] prob of def. energy is hard, but we can get round this by working in our perturbation theory.

In the context of perturbation theory there are various ways to define an energy. To do this we consider how to continue a perturbative solution beyond linear order.

We consider the ungauged vaccum Einstein equations and suppose $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} + \epsilon h^{(1)}_{\mu\nu} + \epsilon^2 h^{(2)}_{\mu\nu}$.

Work to $O(\epsilon^2)$.

We observe
> [Side note] linear Ricci tensor is function of the metric around minkowski space time

$R_{\mu\nu}[\eta_{\mu\nu} + \epsilon h^{(1)}_{\mu\nu}] = \epsilon R^{(1)}_{\mu\nu}[h] + \epsilon^2 R^{(2)}_{\mu\nu}[h]$

and,
$R^{(2)}_{\mu\nu}[h] = \frac{1}{2}h^{\rho\sigma}\partial_\mu\partial_\nu h_{\rho\sigma} - h^{\rho\sigma}\partial_\rho\partial_{(\mu}h_{\nu)\sigma} + \frac{1}{4}\partial_\mu h^{\rho\sigma}\partial_\nu h_{\rho\sigma} - \frac{1}{2}\partial_\rho h^{\rho\sigma} \partial_{(\mu}h_{\nu)\sigma} + \frac{1}{2}h_{\rho\sigma}(\partial_\mu \partial^\rho h^\sigma_\nu + \dots)$ are quadratic terms.

Thus $h^{(2)}$ solves the linearised Einstein equations sourced by an 'energy momentum tensor'.

$\eta^{\sigma\mu}\partial_\sigma G^{(1)}_{\mu\nu}[h] = 0$, which holds for ANY perturbation $h$.
And $\eta^{\sigma\mu}\partial_\sigma t_{\sigma\nu}[h^{(1)}] = 0$ when $h^{(1)}$ satisfies linearised E.E.S.
> [Side note left] total energy is conserved
>
> [Side note right] div free but not gauge invariant!

We can identify $t_{\mu\nu}$ with energy-momentum of the gravitational field, however, it is not gauge invariant. If $h^{(1)}$ decays sufficiently at $\infty$, then $\int t_{00} d^3x$ is invariant, (so gives total energy of field), but no gauge invariant local conservation.

We can get approximate gauge invariance by **averaging**.
Let $W$ be smooth, vanish for $|\mathbf{x}|^2+t^2>a$, and satisfy $\int_{\mathbb{R}^4} W(x,t)dxdt=1$.

$<X_{\mu\nu}(x)> = \int_{\mathbb{R}^4} W(y-x) X_{\mu\nu}(y)d^4y$.

Suppose we're in far field regime, with radiation of wavelength $\lambda$ and we average over a region of size $a \gg \lambda$.
Since $\partial_\mu W \sim W/a$, we have
> [Side note] same as before, integrate by parts

$<\partial_\rho X_{\mu\nu}> = \int_{\mathbb{R}^4} \partial_\rho W(y-x) X_{\mu\nu}(y)d^4y$
roughly of order $\sim \frac{<X_{\mu\nu}>}{a}$
$\implies \frac{<\partial_\rho X_{\mu\nu}>}{<X_{\mu\nu}>} \sim \frac{1}{a} < \frac{1}{\lambda}$

We can ignore total derivatives inside averages, and thus
$<A\partial B> = <\partial(AB)> - <(\partial A)B> \approx -<(\partial A)B>$
> [Side note] integration by parts formula

> [Side note left] this is kind of the result we were looking for all along

3) $<t_{\mu\nu}>$ is gauge invariant.

The averaged spatial energy flux is $S_i = -<t_{0i}>$.
We calculate average energy flux across a sphere of radius $r$ centered on source
$<P> = -\int r^2 d\Omega <t_{0i}>\hat{x}_i$

In wave gauge $<t_{0i}> = \frac{1}{32\pi}<\partial_0\bar{h}_{\rho\sigma}\partial_i\bar{h}^{\rho\sigma} - \frac{1}{2}\partial_0\bar{h}\partial_i\bar{h}>$
> expand out
= $\frac{1}{32\pi}<\partial_0\bar{h}_{jk}\partial_i\bar{h}_{jk} - 2\partial_0\bar{h}_{0j}\partial_i\bar{h}_{0j} + \partial_0\bar{h}_{00}\partial_i\bar{h}_{00} - \frac{1}{2}\partial_0\bar{h}\partial_i\bar{h}>$

Using $\bar{h}_{ij} = \frac{2}{r}\ddot{I}_{ij}(t-r)$
> $0$ IN RADIATION GAUGE

$\partial_0 \bar{h}_{jk} = \frac{2}{r}\dddot{I}_{jk}(t-r) \quad \partial_i \bar{h}_{jk} = (-\frac{2}{r^2}\ddot{I}_{jk}(t-r)\hat{x}_i - \frac{2}{r}\dddot{I}_{jk}(t-r)\hat{x}_i)$

$-\frac{1}{32\pi} \int r^2d\Omega < \partial_0\bar{h}_{jk}\partial_i\bar{h}_{jk}> \hat{x}_i = \frac{1}{5}<\dddot{I}_{ij}\dddot{I}_{ij}>_{t-r}$

**Last lecture:**
*   EM tensor for linearised gravitational perturbations
    $t_{\mu\nu} = -\frac{1}{8\pi} (R^{(2)}_{\mu\nu}[h^{(1)}] - \frac{1}{2}\eta_{\mu\nu}\eta^{\sigma\rho}R^{(2)}_{\sigma\rho}[h^{(1)}])$
    where $R_{\mu\nu}[\eta_{\mu\nu}+\epsilon h_{\mu\nu}] = \epsilon R^{(1)}_{\mu\nu}[h] + \epsilon^2 R^{(2)}_{\mu\nu}[h] + O(\epsilon^2)$
*   After averaging over a window of size $a \gg \lambda$ ($\lambda$ typical wavelength of grav. radiation) have
    $<t_{\mu\nu}> = \frac{1}{32\pi} < \partial_\mu\bar{h}_{\rho\sigma}\partial_\nu\bar{h}^{\rho\sigma} - \frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu\bar{h}\partial_\nu\bar{h} - \frac{1}{2}\eta_{\mu\nu}\eta^{\alpha\beta}(\dots) >$
    > $=0$ IN WAVE GAUGE

**NEW CONTENT**
*   Insert expressions from radiation zone solution derived in previous lectures to compute flux through large sphere
    $<P>_z = -\int r^2 d\Omega <t_{0i}>\hat{x}_i = \frac{1}{5}<\dddot{Q}_{ij}\dddot{Q}_{ij}>_{t-r}$
