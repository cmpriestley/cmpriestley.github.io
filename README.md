# Personal Website

This is my personal website hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Structure

- `index.html` - Homepage with information about me
- `notes.html` - Lecture notes page organized by course
- `style.css` - Stylesheet for the website
- `notes/` - Folder containing PDF lecture notes organized by course
  - `mathematics/` - Mathematics course notes
  - `computer-science/` - Computer Science course notes
  - `physics/` - Physics course notes

## Adding New Lecture Notes

1. Add your PDF files to the appropriate course folder in `notes/`
2. Edit `notes.html` to add links to the new PDFs
3. Commit and push the changes to GitHub

## Customization

Feel free to:
- Edit `index.html` to update personal information
- Add new course sections in `notes.html`

- Modify `style.css` to change the appearance
